Machine learning:
=================== 
  Machine learning is a technique where computers learn patterns from data without 
  being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML: 
============
       There are 3 Main Types
    1.Supervised learning
          Here Model learn from labeled Data, Model learns the realtionship between input and output
          and there are 2 major types 
          1.Regression Model (predicts the numbers) 
          2.Classification  Model (predicts the category)
    2.Unsupervised learning
          it finds hidden pattern in unlabeled data
    3.Reinforcement learning   
          Model learns by reward/punishment

What is a Machine leaning Model
===============================
         A model is a mathematical function that learns relationship in data
  


Supervised learning:
====================
   Linear Regression:
   -------------------
     Linear Regression predicts a continuous value, it tries to draw a straight line that
     best fits the data
