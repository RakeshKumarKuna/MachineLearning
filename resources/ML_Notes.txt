Machine learning:
=================== 
  Machine learning is a technique where computers learn patterns from data without 
  being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML: 
============
       There are 3 Main Types
    1.Supervised learning
          Here Model learn from labeled Data, Model learns the realtionship between input and out put
    2.Unsupervised learning
          it finds hidden pattern in unlabeled data
    3.Reinforcement learning   
          Model learns by reward/punishment
